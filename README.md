## How to use

Welcome to the AQPhotoPicker wiki!

It's a cool Photo Picker app for iOS (tested on iPhone, not on iPad yet), and quite easy to use.

You only have to copy three files in your project:

**AQPhotoPickerView.h**

**AQPhotoPickerView.m**

**AQPhotoPickerView.xib**


Then import **#import "TTImagePickerView.h"** in your own class, and implement the delegate **TTImagePickerViewDelegate**.

You're all set. Now all you've to do is write this code `[AQPhotoPickerView presentInViewController:self];` on the image tap method, or button click. And finally implement this delegate to received the photo from PhotoPicker or Camera.

`-(void)photoFromImagePickerView:(UIImage*) photo {
    
    [imageViewPic setImage:photo];
}`

**DONE.**
